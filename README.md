# Machine Learning portfolio by Lisa Hines
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. 


## Classification Models
### (WIP) Text Classification for customer support
A model that classifies incoming customer queries into categories (e.g., billing, technical support, general inquiry). Classification model implemented using Scikit-learn and NLP applied with NLTK.

## (WIP) Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster




## Natural Language Processing
### SMS Spam Detection Model Binary Classification
[Github](https://github.com/engineerlisa/engineerlisa.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/SMS_Spam_Detection_LR.ipynb)

A machine learning model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam. Uses pandas, scikit-leran, and nltk.





## Large Language Models (LLMs)
### (WIP) Patent Explorer and Comparator
A combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Large Language Model (LLM) powered tool that enables inventors to input their invention ideas and then automatically searches through global patent databases to find related prior art and existing patents. Uses RAG, LLM, eleasticsearch, python, and flask.



## Deep Learning
### (WIP) Smart Traffic Light Simulator
A simulation where the agent controls traffic lights at an intersection. The goal is to optimize traffic flow and minimize waiting times. Has elements like varying traffic volumes, emergency vehicles needing priority, and pedestrian crossings. This can demonstrate skills in multi-agent coordination and real-time decision-making.b
